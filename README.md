This project was made as a way to display and for people to learn about just how a few different search and sort alogirthms work.
It displays how different search algorithms work in an array in the forms of bars and highlights what which data values have been checked.
It shows the comparisons and steps that a sort algorithm makes my highlighting the index's and the values that are being compared to each other. 
This allows for the efficiencies and time complexitys of different algorithms to be compared with a simple visualisation.
